# Agency Gulp App Stub
This is a stub application that should set up the basic folder structure and associated gulp build process. Feel free to add to it and update as needed.

## What's Included
* Local server for deving
* SASS compilation
* Gulp build system
* HTML templating
* Compilation and minification
* JQuery

## Development
How to do stuff...

### Getting Started
* Clone this repo
* `npm install`
* `npm start` to start the server
* `npm run build` to build (and minify) the js and css

### Notes
* When you run the server, it'll automatically build the css on save. It will __not__ build the css and js. To do this, you need to do the actual command `npm run build`. To see the standard implementation, look in the examples folder for `standard.html`. Similarly, to see a built implementation, look for `built.html` in the examples folder.
* You'll need to customize (i.e. replace) pertinant info like project names, versions, application names, etc.
